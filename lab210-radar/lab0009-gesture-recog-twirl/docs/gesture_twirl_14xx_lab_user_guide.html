Overview
===========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to detect and recognize hand gestures. 

<img src="images/twirl_intro.gif" width="400"/> 


The unique range, velocity, and angle data from mmWave sensors can enable the detection of natural gestures. 
This example shows how mmWave can be used to detect a finger twirling gesture and recognize the direction of motion. 
The lab provides full source code, a CCS project, a MATLAB GUI, and runs on the TI mmWave sensor xWR14xx EVM.


Quickstart
===========

The quickstart contains:
* Precompiled binaries for flashing the device using Uniflash
* Visualizer as .exe

* Start CCS and setup workspace as desired. 
* Import the projects below to CCS using either TI Resource Explorer in CCS or CCS Import Projectspecs method:
   * **gesture_twirl_14xx_mss** 
 
[[+d Expand for details on importing via TI Resource Explorer in CCS
* In the top toolbar, navigate to **View > Resource Explorer** 
* In the **Resource Explorer** side panel (not the main panel with "Welcome to.."), navigate to **Software > mmWave Sensors > Industrial Toolbox - <ver> > Labs > Gesture Recognition - Twirl Example**
* Under the expanded **Gesture Recognition Twirl Example** folder, there should be the CCS Project*. 
* Click on the project, which should open the project in the right main panel, and then click on the Import to IDE button <img src="images/import_ide_icon.png" width="40"/>.
+]] 

[[+d Expand for details on importing via CCS Import Projectspecs

  <img src="images/twirl_pjt_impt.png" width="300"/> 
]] 
  
[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace. All modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not touched.
]]
  

### 3. Build the Lab

#### **Build MSS Project**
The DSS project must be built before the MSS project.

With the **geesture_twirl_mss**  project selected in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. Selecting **Rebuild** instead of **Build** ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.

[[g! Successful MSS Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **gesture_twirl_xwr14xx_mss > Debug** directory. The project has been successfully built if the following files appear in the **Debug** folder:
* xwr14xx_gesture_twirl_mss.bin 
]]


[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the [prerequisites](#software) are installed as mentioned in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]


### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* Deployment mode: the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **xwr14xx_gesture_twirl_lab.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\gesture_twirl_14xx_mss\Debug\xwr14xx_gesture_twirl_lab.bin`  
	* The same procedure for flashing can be use as detailed in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-device) section. 
* Debug mode: enables connection with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging
     
  
[[+d Expand for help with Debug mode:
The CCS debug firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) needs to be flashed once on the EVM. 
* CCS Debug method is enabled by flashing the CCS Debug Firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) using the methods covered in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-device) section.
* Use the following image instead       

Image           | Location     | Comment        
--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------
  Meta Image 1/RadarSS    |  `C:\ti\mmwave_sdk_<ver>\packages\ti\utils\ccsdebug\xwr16xx_ccsdebug.bin` | Provided with the mmWave SDK  
  
  
   
After the CCS debug firmware has been flashed, connect the EVM to CCS
  * Create a target configuration (skip to "Open the target..." if config already created previously in another lab for xwr14xx)
    * Go to **File > New > New Target Configuration File**
	* Specify an appropriate file name (ex: IWR16xx.ccxml) and check "**Use shared location**". Click **Finish**.

  * In the configuration editor window:
    * Select **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe** for Connection
    * Select **IWR1443** device as appropriate in the Board or Device text box.
    * Press the **Save** button to save the target configuration.
    * [Optional]: Press the **Test Connection** button to check the connection with the board.

  * Open the target configuration window by going to **View > Target Configurations**.
    * Under **User Defined** configurations the target configuration previously created should appear.
	* Right click on the target configuration and select **Launch Select Configuration**. The target configuration will launch in the **Debug Window**.	
	  <img src="images/target_config.png" width="350"/>

  * Connect
	* Select probe and then right click and select **Connect Target** 
	<img src="images/connect_target_2.png" width="350"/>
	
  * Load the binary
    * With the target connected, click **Load** button in the toolbar. 
    * In the **Load Program** dialog, press the **Browse Project** button .
    * Select **xwr14xx_gesture_twirl_mss.xe674** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\xwr14xx_gesture_twirl_mss\Debug\xwr14xx_gesture_twirl_mss.xe674` and press **Ok**.
	* Press **Ok** again in the **Load Program** dialog.
		
  * Run the binary
    * Press the **Run/Resume** button <img src="images/run_resume_icon.png" width="30"/>
    * The program should start executing and generate console output.
    
	[[g! Successful Run Binary
	If binary is running correctly, the Console will include the “CLI is operational” message which indicates that the program is ready and waiting for the sensor configuration.
	]]
+]]

After executing the lab using either method, the lab can be visualized using the [Quick Start GUI](#2-run-the-lab-visualizer) or continue to working with the GUI Source Code.

Visualizer Source Code
-----------	

{{y Working with and running the Visualizer source files requires a MATLAB License not just the MATLAB Runtime Engine}}

* Open run_demo_dbl_twirl.m, found at: `<mmWave Industrial Toolbox install dir>\labs\lab0009-gesture-recog-twirl\lab0009-gesture-recog-twirl_gui\run_demo_twirl.m`
* Running the .m file results in the same GUI as the Quick Start GUI; please refer to the section for details.
* Files of interest:
  * plot_gesture_dbl_twirl.m: Data streaming and processing for twirl detection
