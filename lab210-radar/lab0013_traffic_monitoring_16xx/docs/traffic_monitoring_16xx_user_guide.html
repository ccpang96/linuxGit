Overview
===========

This lab demonstrates how TI single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology can be used for robust, long-range sensing in traffic monitoring and other applications. 
The advanced tracking feature in the lab enables multivehicle tracking across multiple lanes. The reference design uses the IWR1642BOOST evaluation module (EVM) and integrates a complete radar processing chain onto the IWR1642 device. 
The processing chain includes the analog radar configuration, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capture, low-level FFT processing, and high-level clustering and tracking algorithms.

[[+d Expand for help using Uniflash 
* Connect the EVM to your PC and check the COM ports in **Windows Device Manager**
  * The EVM exports two virtual COM ports as shown below:
    * XDS110 Class Application/User UART (COM UART): Used for passing configuration data and firmware to the EVM
    * XDS110 Class Auxiliary Data Port (COM AUX): Used to send processed radar data output

	<img src="images/com_port.png" width="300"/>
{{b Note the COM UART  and COM AUX port numbers, as they will be used later for flashing and running the lab.}}
* Put the EVM in flashing mode by connecting jumpers on **SOP0** and **SOP2** as shown in the image. Then power cycle the EVM with **SW2**.
  
  <img src="images/flash_jumpers.png" width="300"/>
* Open the **UniFlash tool** ([Download offline tool](http://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH) or use [cloud version](https://dev.ti.com/uniflash/#!/) )
  * In the New Configuration section, locate and select the appropriate device (AWR1642 or IWR1642)
  * Click Start to proceed

* Click the **Settings & Utilities** tab. Under setup, fill the **COM Port** text box with the Application/User UART COM port number (COM UART) noted earlier.  
* In the **Program** tab, browse and locate the images (.bin file) as specified in the lab directions.

 <img src="images/uniflash.png" width="600"/> 

* **Power cycle** the device and click on **Load Images**
	
	[[g! Successful Flash Procedure

]]

* Power off the board and **remove only SOP2 jumper** 

  [[y SOP2 Removed?
Ensure that the jumper has been removed and the EVM power cycled. This puts the board back in functional mode.  
]]
+]]

3. Run the Lab
-----------
To run the lab, launch and configure the visualizer which displays the detection and tracked object data received via UART.

### 1. Launch the visualizer:
* Navigate to `<mmwave_industrial_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\lab0013-traffic-monitoring-16xx\gui\tm_demo.exe`
* Run `tm_demo.exe` 
* After 30-60sec, the setup window should appear
<img src="images/tm_setup_gui_blank.png" width="650"/>

In the setup window, the left side has options and parameters that need to be modified. 
The scene preview figure will update as the options and parameters are changed.


### 2. Configure Visualizer 

#### 1. Select COM Ports
* Specify **UART** and **DATA** COM ports 
* Click **Connect** button.
  
  [[g! COM Status 
Message should update to show that the COM ports have been connected before continuing.
]]

#### 2. Select Config File
* IMPORTANT: For best performance, calibration should be performed and the **mmw_tm_demo_ph2.cfg** file should be modified as described in the "Range Bias and Rx Channel Gain/Offset Measurement and
Compensation" section of the mmWave SDK documentation for the xwr16xx Out of Box Demo. Save the cfg file to save the calibration parameters.
  * This documentation can be found by navigating to `<mmwave_sdk_install_dir>\packages\ti\demo\xwr16xx\mmw\docs\doxygen\html\index.html`
  * The calibration procedure and cfg modification only need to be done once.
* By default, the provided cfg file does not enable calibration since this is device specific. 
 
* To load cfg, Click **Browse Files** and navigate to user's custom cfg file or the default provided **mmw_tm_demo_ph2.cfg** in `<mmwave_industrial_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\lab0013-traffic-monitoring-16xx\chirp_configs`
* Once the cfg has been loaded, the chirp parameter table is populated, if the cfg file included advanced gtrack parameter commands the appropriate tables are also populated.
* THe Scene Preview is updated to reflect the parameters.

#### OPTIONAL: Advanced Gtrack Parameters
* This section exposes some of the advanced gtrack parameters that are commonly modified for a user's use case and environment. 
* For a detailed explanation of the meaning of the parameters, refer to the [TI Design document](http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidud31a/tidud31a.pdf) or 
the document **Tracking radar targets with multiple reflection points** located at `<mmwave_industrial_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\lab0013-traffic-monitoring-16xx\src\mss\gtrack\docs`
* The values of the gtrack parameters can be specified by the command lines in the CFG file or overriden and the values entered in the tables can be used instead. To enable the override, check the checkbox. 
If the values in the tables are changed without enabling the override, the visualization in Scene Preview will be modified but the gtrack algorithm behavior will not be modified. 

#### 3. Scene Geometry
These parameters are to be modified to enable realistic visualization of the scene. They do not affect any processing or algorithm behaviors.
* A) Number of traffic lanes
* B) Lane Width: The number of elements must match the number of traffic lanes. The values represent width in meters and do not have to be identical.
* C) Left lane [m] along x-axis: This specifies the x-axis coordinate of the left most traffic lane. All other lanes are appended towards the right.
* D) Stop bar [m] along y-axis: This specifies the y-axis coordinate of the stop bar.
* E) Start of lane counter: This specifies the y-axis at which to begin counting cars in the scene. Cars between the stop bar and start of lane counter are counted.

**Azimuth Angle**
* This refers to the azimuth tilt of the radar. This parameter is signed use a **+** to indicate angled toward the right and **-** for toward the left. If the EVM is pointed straight down the lanes then the angle would be 0.
* The azimuth angle is specified in the last parameter of the trackingCfg command in the cfg file. However, if there is a discrepency between the value provided in the cfg file and the value specified in the GUI the GUI value will override and take affect.
* If the angle is not specified correctly. Objects will appear to be moving skewed at an incorrect angle relative to actual track.

#### 4. Plotting Area 
* F) [Xmin, Xmax]: Refer to the x-axis limits of the plot. Use to zoom in or out of the scene.
( G) [Ymin, Ymax]: Refer to the y-axis limits of the plot. Use to zoom in or out of the scene. 
  
#### 5. Select folder to save data to
Specify the path to save the data that is being visualized. The files each represent 1000 frames of data. 
Files continue to be created and saved as the visualizer is left running. 
  
### 3. Launch Visualizer

* Click **Start** to launch visualizer with configurations specified. 
* An example setup figure is included below:


<img src="images/tm_setup_gui.png" width="650"/>

 
6. Understanding the Output
-----------
<img src="images/tm_gui_output.png" width="650"/>

The visualizer consists of:
* 1st plot panel (left) with a **Point Cloud** plot. 
    * The black points represent the point cloud returned by the detection layer of the device.
	* Each new tracked object is assigned one of five possible colors (blue, red, green, cyan, and magenta).
	* The small colored ring represents the computed centroid of the point cloud for the tracked object.
	* The "snail trail" trace represent 100 frames of history of the tracked object's centroid.
* 2nd plot panel (right) with a **Gating and Association** plot. 
    * This plot visualizes the result of the tracking algorithm.
	* The bubble is centered over the centroid of of the tracked object. 
* A side panel with Statistics and Visualizer Options
* The video stream of the vehicles are superimposed for illustrative purposes and is not a provided feature.    
	
**Quitting the Visualizer** :
To exit the visualizer use the exit button at the bottom left of the window. This will delete the open serial ports and finish saving.

### 2. Import Lab Project

For the Traffic Monitoring lab, there are two projects, the DSS for the C674x DSP core and the MSS project for the R4F core, that need to be imported to CCS and compiled to generate firmware for the xWR1642.

* Start CCS and setup workspace as desired. 
* Import the projects below to CCS using either TI Resource Explorer in CCS or CCS Import Projectspecs method:
   * **traffic_monitoring_16xx_dss** 
   * **traffic_monitoring_16xx_mss**

[[+d Expand for details on importing via TI Resource Explorer in CCS
* In the top toolbar, navigate to **View > Resource Explorer** 
* In the **Resource Explorer** side panel (not the main panel with "Welcome to.."), navigate to **Software > mmWave Sensors > Industrial Toolbox - <ver> > Labs > Traffic Monitoring - 16xx**
* Under the expanded **Traffic Monitoring - 16xx** folder, there should be two CCS projects, **CCS Project - DSS** and **CCS Project - MSS**. 
* For each of the two projects: Click on the project, which should open the project in the right main panel, and then click on the Import to IDE button <img src="images/import_ide_icon.png" width="40"/>.
+]] 

[[+d Expand for details on importing via CCS Import Projectspecs

]] 
  
[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace. All modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not touched.
]]
  

### 3. Build the Lab

#### **Build DSS Project**
The DSS project must be built before the MSS project.

{{y The DSS project must be built using compiler version 7.4.16. 
To check the build settings, select **traffic_monitoring_16xx_dss** and right click on the project to select **Show build settings...**. 
Under the **General** tab, the **Advanced Settings** section has a drop down menu for **Compiler Version**. 
Ensure that it reads **TI v7.4.16**.}}

With the **traffic_monitoring_16xx_dss**  project selected in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. Selecting **Rebuild** instead of **Build** ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.

[[g! Successful DSS Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **traffic_monitoring_16xx_dss > Debug** directory. The project has been successfully built if the following files appear in the **Debug** folder:
* xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_dss.bin 
* xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_dss.xe674
]]

#### **Build MSS Project**

After the DSS project is successfully built, select **traffic_monitoring_16xx_mss** in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**.

[[g! Successful MSS Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **traffic_monitoring_16xx_mss > Debug** directory. The project has been successfully built if the following files appear in the **Debug** folder:

* xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_mss.bin 
* xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_mss.xer4f
* xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_lab.bin
]]


[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the [prerequisites](#software) are installed as mentioned in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]


### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* Deployment mode: the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_lab.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\traffic_monitoring_16xx_mss\Debug\xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_lab.bin`  
	* The same procedure for flashing can be use as detailed in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-device) section. 
* Debug mode: enables connection with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging
     
  
[[+d Expand for help with Debug mode:
The CCS debug firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) needs to be flashed once on the EVM. 
* CCS Debug method is enabled by flashing the CCS Debug Firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) using the methods covered in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-device) section.
* Use the following image instead       

Image           | Location     | Comment        
--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------
  Meta Image 1/RadarSS    |  `C:\ti\mmwave_sdk_<ver>\packages\ti\utils\ccsdebug\xwr16xx_ccsdebug.bin` | Provided with the mmWave SDK  
  
  
   
After the CCS debug firmware has been flashed, connect the EVM to CCS
  * Create a target configuration (skip to "Open the target..." if config already created previously in another lab for xwr16xx)
    * Go to **File > New > New Target Configuration File**
	* Specify an appropriate file name (ex: IWR16xx.ccxml) and check "**Use shared location**". Click **Finish**.

  * In the configuration editor window:
    * Select **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe** for Connection
    * Select **AWR1642** or **IWR1642** device as appropriate in the Board or Device text box.
    * Press the **Save** button to save the target configuration.
    * [Optional]: Press the **Test Connection** button to check the connection with the board.

  * Open the target configuration window by going to **View > Target Configurations**.
    * Under **User Defined** configurations the target configuration previously created should appear.
	* Right click on the target configuration and select **Launch Select Configuration**. The target configuration will launch in the **Debug Window**.	
	  <img src="images/target_config.png" width="350"/>

  * Group cores and connect
	* Select both the **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug probe/C674X_0** and **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug probe/Cortex_R4_0** and then right click and select **Group core(s)**
	 <img src="images/ccsdebug_groupcores.png" width="350"/>
    * Select **Group 1** and then right click and select **Connect Target** 
	<img src="images/connect_target_2.png" width="350"/>
	
  * Load the binary
    * Once both targets are connected, click on the C674X_0 target and then click **Load** button in the toolbar.  <img src="images/load_program_icon.png" width="40"/>
 
     <img src="images/load_program.png" width="500"/>
	
    * In the **Load Program** dialog, press the **Browse Project** button .
    * Select **xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_dss.xe674** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\traffic_monitoring_16xx_dss\Debug\xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_dss.xe674` and press **Ok**.
	* Press **Ok** again in the **Load Program** dialog.
	* Repeat the above Load the Binary process for the Cortex_R4_0 target, selecting instead **xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_mss.xer4f** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\traffic_monitoring_16xx_mss\Debug\xwr16xx_traffic_monitoring_mss.xer4f`  
	<img src="images/load_program2.png" width="500"/>
	
  * Run the binary
    * Select **Group 1**, press the **Run/Resume** button <img src="images/run_resume_icon.png" width="30"/>
    * The program should start executing and generate console output.
