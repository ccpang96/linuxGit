Overview
===========

This lab enables the estimation and tracking of the position (in the azimuthal plane) and velocity of objects in its 
field of view up to 80 m,travelling as fast as 90kmph. The IWR1642 is configured to be a multi-mode radar, 
meaning that, while it tracks objects at 80m, it can also generate a rich point cloud of objects at 20m, 
so that both objects at a distance, and smaller obstacles close-by can be detected.

3. Run the Lab
-----------
To run the lab, launch and configure the visualizer which displays the detection and tracked object data received via UART.

### 1. Launch the visualizer:
* Navigate to `C:\ti\<mmwave_industrial_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\lab0012-srr-16xx\gui\gui_exe\srr_visualization.exe`
* Run `srr_visualization.exe` 
* After 30-60sec, the setup window should appear
<img src="images/srr_setup_gui.png" width="300"/>


### 2. Configure Visualizer 

#### 1. Select COM Ports
* Specify **UART** and **DATA** COM ports using the drop down menus. 
* Ensure **Reload configuration** checkbox is enabled.


#### 2. GUI options
* Leave default values or alter if desired.
* NOTE: changing these values only change the visualizaion - meaning the axis limits of the plots. It does not change the radar front end settings.
 

#### 3. Record & Replay options
* If recording the session is desired, enable the **Record current session** checkbox. 
* Click the **Browse** button and navigate to the location to save the session. 
  * The file name to record box will update with the path selected.

#### 4. Grid Mapping Options

6. Understanding the Output
-----------
<img src="images/srr_gui_desc.png" width="800"/>

The visualizer consists of:
* A X-Y Scatter plot. 
    * The plot depicts detected and tracked objects and/or points.
    * The legend at the right indicates the significance of the various symbols.
	* The pink line can be interpreted as the free space around the radar that is constrained by the presence of objects in the scene.
* A Doppler-Range plot
	* The plot indicates the velocity of tracked objects.
* The synchronized video is overlayed for illustration purposes. It is not part of the GUI.

### 2. Import Lab Project

For the People Counting lab, there are two projects, the DSS for the C674x DSP core and the MSS project for the R4F core, that need to be imported to CCS and compiled to generate firmware for the xWR1642.

* Start CCS and setup workspace as desired. 
* Import the projects below to CCS using either TI Resource Explorer in CCS or CCS Import Projectspecs method:
   * **srr_16xx_dss** 
   * **srr_16xx_mss**

[[+d Expand for details on importing via TI Resource Explorer in CCS
* In the top toolbar, navigate to **View > Resource Explorer** 
* In the **Resource Explorer** side panel (not the main panel with "Welcome to.."), navigate to **Software > mmWave Sensors > Industrial Toolbox - <ver> > Labs > People Counting Demo**
* Under the expanded **SRR - 16xx** folder, there should be two CCS projects, **CCS Project - DSS** and **CCS Project - MSS**. 
* For each of the two projects: Click on the project, which should open the project in the right main panel, and then click on the Import to IDE button <img src="images/import_ide_icon.png" width="40"/>.
+]] 

[[+d Expand for details on importing via CCS Import Projectspecs
* In the top toolbar, navigate to **Project > Import CCS Projects...** 
* With the **Select search-directory** option enabled, click **Browse...**, navigate to the **lab0012-srr-16xx** folder at `C:\ti\<mmwave_industrial_toolbox_install_dir>\labs\lab0012-srr-16xx`, and then click **OK**.
* Under **Discovered projects**, select **srr_16xx_dss** and **srr_16xx_mss** (ignore any other projects), then click **Finish**. 
+]]

[[g! Successful Import to IDE
  After using either method, both project should be visible in **CCS Project Explorer**
  <img src="images/srr_pjt_impt.png" width="300"/> 
]] 
  
[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace. All modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not touched.
]]
  

### 3. Build the Lab

#### **Build DSS Project**
The DSS project must be built before the MSS project.

With the **srr_16xx_dss**  project selected in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. Selecting **Rebuild** instead of **Build** ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.

[[g! Successful DSS Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **pplcount_16xx_dss > Debug** directory. The project has been successfully built if the following files appear in the **Debug** folder:
* xwr16xx_srr_dss.bin 
* xwr16xx_srr_dss.xe674
]]

#### **Build MSS Project**

After the DSS project is successfully built, select **srr_16xx_mss** in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**.

[[g! Successful MSS Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **srr_16xx_mss > Debug** directory. The project has been successfully built if the following files appear in the **Debug** folder:

* xwr16xx_srr_mss.bin 
* xwr16xx_srr_mss.xer4f
* xwr16xx_srr_lab.bin
]]


[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the [prerequisites](#software) are installed as mentioned in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]


### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* Deployment mode: the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **xwr16xx_srr_lab.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\srr_16xx_mss\Debug\xwr16xx_srr_lab.bin`  
	* The same procedure for flashing can be use as detailed in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-device) section. 
* Debug mode: enables connection with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging
     
  
[[+d Expand for help with Debug mode:
The CCS debug firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) needs to be flashed once on the EVM. 
* CCS Debug method is enabled by flashing the CCS Debug Firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) using the methods covered in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-device) section.
* Use the following image instead       

Image           | Location     | Comment        
--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------
  Meta Image 1/RadarSS    |  `C:\ti\mmwave_sdk_<ver>\packages\ti\utils\ccsdebug\xwr16xx_ccsdebug.bin` | Provided with the mmWave SDK  
  
  
   
After the CCS debug firmware has been flashed, connect the EVM to CCS
  * Create a target configuration (skip to "Open the target..." if config already created previously in another lab for xwr16xx)
    * Go to **File > New > New Target Configuration File**
	* Specify an appropriate file name (ex: IWR16xx.ccxml) and check "**Use shared location**". Click **Finish**.

  * In the configuration editor window:
    * Select **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe** for Connection
    * Select **AWR1642** or **IWR1642** device as appropriate in the Board or Device text box.
    * Press the **Save** button to save the target configuration.
    * [Optional]: Press the **Test Connection** button to check the connection with the board.

  * Open the target configuration window by going to **View > Target Configurations**.
    * Under **User Defined** configurations the target configuration previously created should appear.
	* Right click on the target configuration and select **Launch Select Configuration**. The target configuration will launch in the **Debug Window**.	
	  <img src="images/target_config.png" width="350"/>

  * Group cores and connect
	* Select both the **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug probe/C674X_0** and **Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug probe/Cortex_R4_0** and then right click and select **Group core(s)**
	 <img src="images/ccsdebug_groupcores.png" width="350"/>
    * Select **Group 1** and then right click and select **Connect Target** 
	<img src="images/connect_target_2.png" width="350"/>
	
  * Load the binary
    * Once both targets are connected, click on the C674X_0 target and then click **Load** button in the toolbar.  <img src="images/load_program_icon.png" width="40"/>
 
     <img src="images/load_program.png" width="500"/>
	
    * In the **Load Program** dialog, press the **Browse Project** button .
    * Select **xwr16xx_srr_dss.xe674** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\srr_16xx_dss\Debug\xwr16xx_srr_dss.xe674` and press **Ok**.
	* Press **Ok** again in the **Load Program** dialog.
	* Repeat the above Load the Binary process for the Cortex_R4_0 target, selecting instead **xwr16xx_srr_mss.xer4f** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\srr_16xx_mss\Debug\xwr16xx_srr_mss.xer4f`  
	<img src="images/load_program2.png" width="500"/>
	
  * Run the binary
    * Select **Group 1**, press the **Run/Resume** button <img src="images/run_resume_icon.png" width="30"/>
    * The program should start executing and generate console output.
