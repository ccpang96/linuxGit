This sample driver module may be used with or without the kernel rcim
driver configured/built into the currently executing kernel.

However, if the system has an RCIM III and the kernel rcim driver IS
configured into the kernel, then disable use of MSI interrupts with
"rcim.nomsi=1" on the grub boot command line since MSI interrupts may
not be shared between this sample driver and the kernel's rcim driver.

To compile the module do:
        $ cd "path to module source code"
        $ su
        # make config
        # make

To load the module and create the device file do:
        $ su
        # insmod ./sample_mod.ko
        # sh ./sample_mknod.sh

To compile and run the user-level example do:
	$ cc -o usersample usersample.c
        $ ./usersample

To unload the module do:
        # rmmod sample_mod
